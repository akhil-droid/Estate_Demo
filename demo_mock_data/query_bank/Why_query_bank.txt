For Demo:

Pick any query → Feed to your Orchestrator → Show it creating execution plan → Agents execute → Result
75 realistic scenarios = never run out of demo material

For Agents:

Orchestrator reads query_type + expected_workflow → knows which agents to call
Scout/Intelligence use sample_property_id, sample_buyer_id → fetch real entity data
Content uses context_required → knows what info to include in outputs
expected_agents + expected_subtasks → validates your agent is making correct decisions

Simply: Queries are the INPUT your agents receive. They trigger everything.
